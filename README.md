# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

In order for this study guide web application to be visible and usable I had to create it using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These were languages I wasn't familiar with at first. Once I learned how to code in these languages and use new software tools I was able to create this web application. This was a great sense of accomplishment knowing that now a study guide existed which could be used and reviewed. This is what motivated me, to see something I created come to life and be visible for the public. 
I built this web application project to solve a common problem new boot camp students face. 
The amount of information a student learns each day can become overwhelming which makes it difficult to keep track. 
This web application is an excellent source to display and store information. All of the information can be easily found and read. It will hold the notes taken throughout prework and have them all in one place to be used as a study guide. 
In the process of building this web application project many new factors learned throughout the prework were applied. Certain application were also installed to develop it. One of the things learned was how to input text commands to execute operating system functions such as opening a file or creating a new folder using command line interface. This allowed us to interface with git commands and connect with GitHub by tracking our versions locally as well as storing our repo in the cloud for easy collaborations. Through this we learned how to create a Github repository with a README file and Github issues. Once we connected our local environment to our GitHub repository we were able to use Git version control to save our work. Another thing learned was creating feature branches and each one followed the Git workflow steps to add, commit, and push our work. This was followed by opening a pull request and merging our changes with the main branch. This allowed us to close off our GitHub issues. With what we learned so far we were now able to build our web application. We learned how to create the HTML, add CSS, add basic JavaScript and Functions to the Prework Study Guide web application. In HTML we learned how to set up it's sections and child elements. This structured our web application. In CSS we learned how to create a CSS file and link it to the HTML file. This allowed us to add style using class attributes. In JavaScript we learned to write a Function and call the Function incorporating arrays and for loops. This allowed us to use console.log to test the interactivity of our website. We were able to apply everything we learned in the prework to build this study guide web application project.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. Each section contians notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). You will be able to see JavaScript running. A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
